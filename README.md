# tic-tack-toe-game-OpenGL
The "Tic Tack Toe" project was made using OpenGL and using C++.The aim of the mini project is to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first wins  the game. Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship.
